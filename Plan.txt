Create accounts for buisnesses
Then have it be verifiable by some email address(probably club email address)
Once verified by email address, the buisness account is created
After logging in, can select a page, and create an application
Reponses to Application questions are stored
Compiled together to create something similar to a job oppurtunity button like on indeed(reference slideshow)
Have students be able to view oppurtunity
There will be a link that will take them to the websites page
